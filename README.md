# IDP208

A month long project carried out in a group of 6 to design and build an autonomous robot with the objective of locating randomly placed objectives, detecting their magneticity and then returning all non-magnetic objectives to a designated area. As part of the software team I designed and developed the navigational algorithms to allow the robot to interact with the world and to search algorithms to locate objectives. The code was written in C++ and was implemented on an Arduino.
